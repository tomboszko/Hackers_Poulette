## consolidation exercice: contact form for customer support in PHP

This project isn't deployed because of github page allow static pages only.

globally, I didn't had many issues but here are the main:

1. As usual, always some struggles with the styling side of the project, so I managed to first work on backend side, I wanted that all was working before working on styling side.
   
2. I didn't found a correct way for displaying a picture as background image... (using SASS)

3. The only ''backend'' issue was to find a way to reset the form when go back to it after confirmation message... And I didn't found yet... (tried with sessions in PHP and also with some JS)

4. Finally, I'm always disturbed by the design and styling side, because I know waht i want but I can't find ways to code it in a easy and correct way...

But, I really like to work with PHP, it's a very clear langage and I'm really fluent in data management, I was thinking about become a fullstack dev but I'm beginning to hesitate and choose backend only.
